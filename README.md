# Auto-Battler Game Project Ideation

## Description
Arena auto-battler where the player creates a team of creatures and goes head-to-head against other teams.<br>
Battles occur in real-time side-scrolling combat and creatures act automatically as they have their own sets of behaviors to execute during combat.<br>
Before each battle, there is a preparation phase where the player can adjust the team members and their order, gain/buy upgrades or modifiers, and sell creatures for currency.<br>
Determining factors are player foresight, team composition synergy, order of creatures, upgrades and modifiers, decisions taken between battles, and luck.<br>

## Design Principles:
1. Focus on events that affect movement and positioning, giving visceral feedback to user and creature actions. This is the USP.<br>
2. Modifiers must be meaningful gameplay enhancements/modifications, not just number adjustments.<br>
3. Gameplay must strike a balance between player agency and randomness, offering a rewarding experience for skilled decision-makers but inducing variety such that outcomes are not entirely predictable.<br>

## Creature ideas:
Rammer - melee, move forward quickly, pushing all enemies in the way<br>
Flinger - melee, throws the nearest enemy to far away behind it<br>
Diver - melee, jumps onto the nearest enemy, knocking up all enemies near the impact point<br>
Bypasser - melee, jumps over the nearest enemy and attacks the nearest enemy after<br>
Pusher - melee, move forward quickly and stops at the nearest enemy, knocks this enemy very far away<br>
Slammer - melee, latches onto the nearest airborne enemy then pulls them down to the ground<br>
Puller - melee, pulls the nearest enemy from far away into melee range<br>
Hugger - melee, latches onto the nearest enemy and prevents them from moving or taking any action<br>
Launcher - ranged, pulls nearest ally then launches them to the nearest enemy, knocking up all enemies at the point of impact<br>
Blocker - melee, hunkers down and becomes immune to displacement effects from enemies<br>
Rooter - ranged, restrains the nearest enemy, preventing them from moving<br>
Bomber - ranged, throws a bomb at the second nearest enemy, knocking back all enemies from the point of impact<br>
